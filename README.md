# hashmap-implementation-python
This project implements the basic functionality of a hash map (initialization, hash function, insertion, deletion, and retrieval) using lists. It runs in amortized constant time for insertion, deletion, and retrieval (assuming the hash function is not changed and the values to be hashed are not incredibly numerous). This project also contains PyUnit tests, which tests each of these functions to ensure they work as desired.
